# Hyperspace Minutes of Meeting --- 17. 08. 2022.

## Attendees:
* Vladimir M.
* Marija P.
* Dejan P.
* Nikola P.
* Vukan D.
* Aleksandar K.

## Progress & updates:
* [x] Vukan is working on an angle-FFT implementation in TDM and BPM modes, with Marija's help.
* [x] Angle-FFT work goes on, to be finished in one month.
* [x] HDMI-based visualization with simultaneous 1-D and 2-D FFT will work.
* [x] DFP as mmWaveStudio replacement works, but should be better documented and configurations should be added.

## To-do list:
* [ ] Start with hyperspace automatization.
* [ ] Base hyperspace repository as a chipyard submodule.
* [ ] Convert dsp-blocks (nco, cfar, sdf-fft, etc.) to newest Chisel version compatible with Chipyard.
* [ ] Send a trivial test example of dsptools and rocket-dsp-utils to ekiwi. Marija & Nikola
* [ ] Try solving timing problems using newer Vivado version and better clock distribution constraints. -Vukan & Kondic
* [ ] Eventually try angle-FFT with AWR2944 EVM.
* [ ] Mezzanine board. -Nikola P.
